## Draw with CSS

Project for a one-week RC pop-up in Berlin.

### Day 1

1. Set up translating JS into CSS
  * make a simple GUI with shapes to be added to a canvas and   
  translate the canvas to pure CSS

2. Check out ways to use primitives to generate images:
  * [FreeCodeCamp article](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/using-svg-as-placeholders-more-image-loading-techniques-bed1b810ab2c)
  * [GitHub repo on primitive pictures](https://github.com/fogleman/primitive) - thanks Adrien!

3. Check out the [Drawing with the Right Side of the Brain](https://www.amazon.de/Drawing-Right-Side-Brain-Definitive/dp/1585429201) book - thanks Mehul!

Progress:
- created a simple demo - [preview](https://codepen.io/trueskawka/pen/javVOM)
- explored `box-shadow`'s and `drop-shadow`'s limits, mainly their inability to
duplicate more than one custom shape consistently
- read a bit about primitive images and planned work for tomorrow
