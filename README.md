## Draw with CSS

Project for a one-week RC pop-up in Berlin.

### Day 1

1. Set up translating JS into CSS
  * make a simple GUI with shapes to be added to a canvas and   
  translate the canvas to pure CSS

2. Check out ways to use primitives to generate images:
  * [FreeCodeCamp article](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/using-svg-as-placeholders-more-image-loading-techniques-bed1b810ab2c)
  * [GitHub repo on primitive pictures](https://github.com/fogleman/primitive) - thanks Adrien!

3. Check out the [Drawing with the Right Side of the Brain](https://www.amazon.de/Drawing-Right-Side-Brain-Definitive/dp/1585429201) book - thanks Mehul!

Progress:
- created a simple demo - [preview](https://codepen.io/trueskawka/pen/javVOM)
- explored `box-shadow`'s and `drop-shadow`'s limits, mainly their inability to
duplicate more than one custom shape consistently
- read a bit about primitive images and planned work for tomorrow

### Day 2

1. Explore gradients and mirroring them
2. Figure out if I want to write a custom CSS filter
3. Go through some parts of "Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain"
4. Further explore the primitive images
5. Make Google Code-In logo in pure CSS

Progress:
- decided not to try and write a custom CSS filter
- changed the implementation from `box-shadow` to gradients - [preview](https://codepen.io/trueskawka/pen/OOBOVR)
- drew 4 exercises from "Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain"
- made a [GCI logo animation](https://codepen.io/trueskawka/pen/ooazRq)
